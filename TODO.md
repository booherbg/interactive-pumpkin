# TODO

## Final Checklist
    - [x] Remove the admin link from the pumpkin page (LLM)
    - [x] Add random effect button in subtitle of modal; will pick a random effect from the list of effects shown on the page (LLM)
    - [x] Add random palette button in subtitle of modal; will pick a random palette from list of pallettes shown on the page (LLM)
    - [x] Solid and Color Palletes (1+2, gradient) remove white and warm white; Replace Cyan, Magenta, Yellow with slightly less intense versions if they don't already exist (to prevent dual-diode flicker) (LLM)
    - [x] Remove purple from solid colors (too similar to magenta) (LLM)
    - [x] Update 'reset' functionality (LLM):
        - [x] When resetting (via button click and after screen saver is touched after the period of time), instead of of resetting to preset 1, let's just reset the whole pumpkin to solid color effect with a soft orange (LLM)
        - [x] New feature: When the screensaver is active, after 3 minutes of inactivity, reset to preset 1 for both controllers (this is what the previous reset functionality did). This way after a few minutes, the pumpkin will go back to default mode (LLM)
    - [ ] When clicking either rim, send to both. No more separate left/right outer rims - clicking either should alway send to both (LLM)
    - [x] Organize palettes into good groupings (ME)
    - [x] Add wifi mac addresses to LED DREAMS (ME)
    - [x] Update Raspi with this project and startup (ME)
    - [x] Final test of whole system (ME)
    - [x] "Reset" should mean clean slate, simple (TBD)
    - [x] "Playlist 1" Should run after 5 minutes of inactivity (TBD)
